Title: Very simple high level analysis of Affymetrix data
Version: 2.64.0
Author: Crispin J Miller
Description: Provides high level functions for reading Affy .CEL files,
        phenotypic data, and then computing simple things with it, such
        as t-tests, fold changes and the like. Makes heavy use of the
        affy library. Also has some basic scatter plot functions and
        mechanisms for generating high resolution journal figures...
